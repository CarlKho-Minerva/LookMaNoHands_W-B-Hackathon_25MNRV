08/02/2025 | A poem entitled Agency.

You know us; we‚Äôre the nameless ones.

We hold the keys to fear
and codes to unlock emails, banks,
identities.

We are the armies of oppression
to those who still think they are free.

Anonymous, we do not debate
in outdated halls of government, but haunt circuits
of data, knowledge, information.

We see the things you see,
we read the words you write;
we are the cloud, the web, the ether.

We can slice your credit like a pumpkin pie,
saving the tastiest bytes for later;

we can track your contacts like a faithful hound,
barking proximity alerts to agents;

we can correct your ballot
in the voting machine.

Next time a laptop camera blinks,
next time a connection is denied;

next time a journalist disappears,
next time a chatroom troll tells lies;

next time a murderer walks free,
next time a reaper drone spews fire

consider how
the world is ours.  You know us.
We‚Äôre the nameless ones. | https://bsky.app/profile/kanikoski.bsky.social/post/3lhp5snv7sc2v | bsky.app | Bruce the Brit

03/02/2025 | I spent a few hours with OpenAI's Operator automating expense reports. Most corporate jobs require filing expenses, so Operator could save *millions* of person-hours every year if it gets this right.

Some insights on what worked, what broke, and why this matters for the future of agents üßµ | https://bsky.app/profile/sayash.bsky.social/post/3lhc4xcjcq22d | bsky.app | Sayash Kapoor
03/02/2025 | In the end, Operator struggled to file my expense reports even after an hour of trying and prompting. Then I took over, and my reports were filed 5 minutes later. 

This is the bind for web agents today: not reliable enough to be automatable, not quick enough to save time. | https://bsky.app/profile/sayash.bsky.social/post/3lhc54xmh2s2d | bsky.app | Sayash Kapoor
29/01/2025 | I am wading through web pages of literary agents, lookling for guests, and I raise my hat to the agent whose biography says ‚Äì ‚ÄúShe has no interest in Wellness, how-to or anything remotely ‚Äòinspirational‚Äô.‚Äù | https://bsky.app/profile/nndroid.bsky.social/post/3lgviyvdol22r | bsky.app | Andrew Harrison
24/01/2025 | I suspect we‚Äôre going to find there is little demand for Operator-like agents that go out on the web and do shopping for you‚Äîbut huge demand for personal assistants that have read all your email and all your files and can see the 3 tasks you forgot to finish. | https://bsky.app/profile/tedunderwood.me/post/3lgils45rg22j | bsky.app | Ted Underwood
24/01/2025 | With the upcoming growth of AI agents like Operator by OpenAI, we could see an uptick in "Agent Hostile" design practices on the web. Chaotic layouts, elements, and element tagging to make it difficult for AI agents to interpret and use websites. | https://bsky.app/profile/davidwbcutler.bsky.social/post/3lgiqwoxw4k2b | bsky.app | David Cutler
23/01/2025 | Played with the new Operator for a little bit before launch:
1) General purpose web agents aren‚Äôt there yet, but seem more workable than expected(Operator is quite good)
2) Companies aren‚Äôt thinking enough about how to market to the preferences of agents
3) Security is going to get very weird fast | https://bsky.app/profile/emollick.bsky.social/post/3lggq7w2mok2e | bsky.app | Ethan Mollick
16/01/2025 | Excited to keynote @infoq.comDev Summit Boston '25! Everyone's hyping AI agents, but we only hear from investors & experts. Time for the builder's perspective.

At @qconferences.comand other conferences in the 2010s, we focused on democratizing web-scale tech. Now it's time to do the same with AI! | https://bsky.app/profile/philcalcado.com/post/3lfupgnauik25 | bsky.app | Phil Cal√ßado
10/01/2025 | I would like #CopilotStudioto include a headless web browser for its Agents.

That way I could really browse the web the same way a human does. | https://bsky.app/profile/matthewdevaney.com/post/3lfferomqms22 | bsky.app | Matthew Devaney
30/12/2024 | No one talks about how AI agents are a two-sided market problem. When you‚Äôre building an AI Agent product, you‚Äôre not just building a product for human users, you‚Äôre also building a product for the agent, whether that‚Äôs simple function calls or full-on scripts and web apps | https://bsky.app/profile/mocutobi.bsky.social/post/3leka3za5p22m | bsky.app | Tobi
20/12/2024 | Funny, I had a conversation at my last armory about how there was nothing resembling phyrexians in #fabtcgfor me to become attached to, and then here comes Funnel Web looking like someone right out of the Chrome Host

Murdered undercover agents, threats to subordinates and a web of deceit

17/01/2024 | Systems thinking in action: I was supporting a team in using #DomainDrivenDesignprinciples and practices, and their use case is to build a model that will sit between SAP and the different channels (think about web and mobile apps for customers, customer support agents, and whatnot).

08/04/2024 | Probably more obscure, but my favorite one is "I should buy binary XML support" :)

And I loled at the chromie "we're not the badies" charade.

Otherwise, a bit surprised to see no mention of web engines as bedrock for user agents, and how that could be leveraged. | https://bsky.app/profile/fabrice.capyloon.org/post/3kpn2nwlwzv2v | bsky.app | Fabrice

15/11/2024 | The old, old method was to use a manual, and look in books, but often acknowledgements delete agents because the agents doesn't want to be mentioned, so it's better to use the web and back trace. For white straight males the query amount is about 70-ish rejections. For PoCs, double that. | https://bsky.app/profile/kimyoonmi.bsky.social/post/3lazil5e4u22e | bsky.app | ÍπÄÏú§ÎØ∏ Kim Yoonmi (Surname First)
11/11/2024 | two weeks ago, i came up with an idea: a platform where anyone could create custom ai agents, integrate them into any website, sell them or to just chat with right from the app. as i was heading for web summit 2024, i committed to having a functional mvp, ready to showcase there | https://bsky.app/profile/sousadev.com/post/3lape4ivwds2t | bsky.app | Sousa
